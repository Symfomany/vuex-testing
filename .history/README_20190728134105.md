# POC Project

# Lifecycle

https://alligator.io/vuejs/component-lifecycle/


## BeforeCreate
The beforeCreate hook runs at the very *initialization of your component*. data has not been made reactive, and events have not been set up yet.

##  Created
In the created hook, you will be able to access reactive *data and events are active*. 
Templates and Virtual DOM have not yet been mounted or rendered.

## Mounting : beforeMount + mounted
Mounting hooks are often *the most-used hooks*, for better or worse.
 They allow you to access your component immediately *before and after the first render*. 
 They do not, however, run during server-side rendering.

Use if: You *need to access or modify the DOM* of your component immediately before or after the initial render.

*Do not use i*f: You need to fetch some data for your component on initialization. Use created (or created + activated for keep-alive components) for this instead, especially *if you need that data during server-side rendering.*


## Updating : beforeUpdate + updated

Updating hooks are called whenever *a reactive property used by your component changes*, or something else *causes it to re-render*. They allow you to hook into the watch-compute-render cycle for your component.

## Test

Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
